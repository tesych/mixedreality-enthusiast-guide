# Plug in your headset

## Connect your headset to your PC's USB 3.0 port

Identify the USB 3.0 port on your computer and plug in the USB cable. USB 3.0 ports have SS (Super Speed) written next to them. They are often (but not always) blue.

If you do not have enough open USB ports on your PC, you can use an [AC-powered external USB 3.0 hub](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md#using-external-usb-30-hubs-with-windows-mixed-reality-headsets).

## Connect your headset to your PC's HDMI out port

Identify the HDMI out port on your computer and plug in the headset's HDMI cable. Make sure you are **not** plugging into the HDMI in port!

## Connect headphones to your headset

Unless you purchased a Samsung HMD Odyssey headset (which has integrated AKG headphones and an integrated dual-array microphone), you will need to connect headphones (preferably with an inline microphone) that can plug into your headset's 3.5mm audio jack.

## Common issues
* You plugged in the HDMI cable before plugging in the USB 3.0 cable.  Make sure that you plug in the USB 3.0 cable **before** plugging in the HDMI cable.
* You plugged in a bluetooth adapter next to your HMD's USB cable.  If you are using a Bluetooth adapter, **do not** plug in your headset's USB cable next to that adapter as the resulting radio interference may negatively impact Bluetooth performance.
* You plugged in your HDMI cable to your iGPU HDMI port instead of your dGPU HDMI port (for PCs with both). Some Desktop PCs have both an integrated graphics processing unit (iGPU) and a discrete graphics processing unit (dGPU) and often the iGPU ports will be disabled. If your PC does have a dGPU your headset needs to be plugged into the dGPU.  
* If your PC doesn't have an HDMI port, you may need an adapter. [View the full list of recommended adapters here](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md). 
* You are connecting your headset to a Surface device. Please read [using Surface with Windows Mixed Reality](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md#windows-mixed-reality-and-surface).
